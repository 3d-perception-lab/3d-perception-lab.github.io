## Fundamental 3D Perception Research 

We develop novel signal processing, sensor fusion techniques and optimization techniques for 3D localization and mapping. Our topics of interest include:

- **Acquisition:** geometry, calibration, time synchronization, infrared imaging, multi-spectral imaging

- **Analysis:** feature detection and description, shape recognition, segmentation, motion estimation and tracking

- **Sensor fusion:** multi-modal data integration, state estimation, filtering, non-linear optimization, continuous-time optimization

- **Reconstruction:** structure from motion, multi-view stereo, dense mapping, simultaneous localization and mapping

- **Rendering:** 3D data visualization, neural rendering, synthetic data generation

Some example developments include:

## 3D Perception for Downstream Applications


Collaborating with other departments and research units, we deliver state-of-the-art 3D perception systems used as a component in other systems for applications such as:

- **Autonomous systems:** robotics, drones, self-driving vehicles, path planning
- **Augmented and virtual Reality:** AR/VR environments, spatial tracking, human-computer interaction, immersive rendering
- **Demining:** mine or threat detection and classification
- **Geospatial mapping:** 3D mapping for situational awareness, digital twins
