## Fundamental 3D Perception Research 

We develop novel signal processing, sensor fusion techniques and optimization techniques for 3D localization and mapping. Our projects include:

## 3D Perception for Downstream Applications


Collaborating with other departments and research units, we deliver state-of-the-art 3D perception systems used as a component in other systems for applications such as mine detection, autonomous robot navigation, 3D reconstruction, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). For example, we develop the following sensor systems:
