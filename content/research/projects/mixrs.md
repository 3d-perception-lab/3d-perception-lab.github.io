## Context and motivation

Asymmetric warfare situations and the continuous risk of terrorist attacks place Belgian Defence soldiers in dangerous situations where they have to correctly assess very complex situations in a minimum of time. Advanced sensors like visual and thermal cameras and sensing vectors like RPAS are being deployed to remedy this problem, but these also add to the information overload that soldiers need to process. In its original form, this research study proposed to develop an extended reality support system that assists individual soldiers in collecting, processing and analysing data without taking their eyes and attention from their environment and without causing cognitive overload.

Due to a spark of interest in Virtual Reality (VR) technology from the different Components of the Belgian Defense since the start of this study, the addition of a VR component to this study proposal is requested. In fact, VR opens the way for a new class of training and simulations with multiple advantages over traditional training such as increased availability, realism, repeatability and objectivity. Partnering up with an industrial partner (OneBonsai) in a Triple Helix framework, high-TRL VR systems will be put at the disposal of Belgian Defence clients to answer a recurring and growing demand.

The proposed study will research cross-domain scientific innovations in the fields of computer vision, robotics, human-system integration, machine learning to develop an augmented and virtual reality support system that will support the soldier in each phase of the sense-plan-act decision chain. As a result of this study, Belgian Defence will have at its disposal a proof-of-concept augmented reality system consisting of COTS/MOTS hardware and a custom software augmented reality toolbox, together with multiple Virtual Reality training platforms tailored to the needs of Belgian Defence clients. 

## Objectives

This study proposes cross-domain and cross-cutting research, spanning the research fields of computer vision, mathematics, robotics, data management and human system integration and proposing a differentiated mix of highly scientifically innovative contributions (real-time calibration, high-accuracy localization of team-mates and potentially occluded objects, machine-learning on low-power devices) and higher-Technology Readiness Level innovations which can have a direct impact on the soldier’s performance on the terrain (2D Augmented Reality applications like camera sharing, approximate localization of teammates). 
Human factors are a crucial aspect for the success of the proposed study, as the adoption of the system on the field by the soldiers stands of falls with thorough human-system integration. Therefore, we will follow an iterative development process by having regular interim design review meetings with the clients, developing, and integrating the necessary hardware and software toolboxes as a prototype system that will be validated by the end users and further optimized during the experiments. Finally, the optimized prototype model will be tested and validated in a demonstration scenario together with the Defence units. Collection of extensive experimental data sets during the trial campaigns can be shared with relevant stakeholders for further benchmarking purposes. At various periods during the study there will be opportunities to publish relevant research results.
